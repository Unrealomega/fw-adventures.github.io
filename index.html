				<p>Hey there everyone!  I hope you're doing well.  This has been a long time coming, but...I'm officially ending <strong>FW! Adventueres.</strong></p>
				<p>I put a lot of time and effort into this, something like 230+ comics, not counting filler ones, spanning 5 years.  I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish and do; I grew as an artist, a writer...And I'm honestly very very sad to be typing all this up.</p>
				<p>The amount of support and love I received while working on it still touches me to this day. Fan art, just letters from people who enjoyed it, who grew up with it...That kind of convinced me that I needed to call it quits, after taking so very long to ever get back to it. I've never been able to dedicate the time and effort I really wanted to after the first few years, and it showed.  Multiple black and white sketch comics, some without color, the ideas and artwork suffering because of real life interfering; it wasn't fair to the readers at all.  If there's one regret I've had, its that.</p>
				<p>I was gone too long. I missed too much. I spent years trying to figure out how to dip back into things, to keep it running regularly like I wanted to without it completely destroying what little free time I had, the time I had with friends and family.  I couldn't balance it. I spent years watching as other, better writers and artists did what I wanted to do, but better, more consistently.  I watched them form fanbases that I'd wished I'd had, that I knew I could have made happy...But it just never worked out.</p>
				<p>So as I sat here, around 5 years after I took a "hiatus", I realized I couldn't do it. I don't have a real way to keep FW!A going.  And instead of having a stagnant site with no new content, with nothing moderated or responded to.  If I was going to move on to anything else, I had to clean up what was left behind.</p>
				<p>So!  I've put up the archives for the comic, I think that's the complete collection, though if I missed anything anyone remembers just let me know, I'll fix it and put it up right away.</p>
				<p>I still do draw, for what its worth. I've improved a lot, at least I feel I have.  FW, or Forest, is still a very prominent figure in a lot of things I do, but you can check things out at the above link(s) if you'd like. I can't guarantee all the old cast will show up, but its something at least, right?</p>
				<p>Regardless, if you're reading this, <strong>thank you</strong> for the continued support, even after the comic stopped updating. <strong>Thank you</strong> for checking in on things.  Hopefully, one day, the wolf will go on another silly, everyday adventure.</p>
				<p>Catch you all later!</p>
				<p>-Will</p>
